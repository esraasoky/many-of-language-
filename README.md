Translation or transfer is the process of converting an original written text (called the source text) from the source language to a written text (the target text) in the other language.  Translation is considered a transfer of civilization, culture and thought. [1]  Translation is divided into written, written, text, interpretation, oral and audio translation.  In essence, translation is not merely the transfer of every word to what it corresponds to in the target language, but rather the transfer of the rules of the language that delivers the information, the transfer of the information itself, and the transfer of the writer's thought, culture and style as well.  Trinity of translation: literal (or word for word), free (denotation by significance) and faithful translation
